# Git It

## Summary

Git It is a full-stack PERN app designed as a mock coding-related merch site.

The Git It client-side allows users to view products, add and delete items from their shopping cart and complete a demo checkout process. The connected API was also written by me and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/SabrinaSides/git-it-server).
